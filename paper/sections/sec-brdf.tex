\paragraph*{BRDF design.}

The BRDF $f(\mathbf{\omega_i}, \mathbf{\omega_o})$ of a material defines how much light it reflects from each incoming direction $\mathbf{\omega_i}$ to each outgoing direction $\mathbf{\omega_o}$. If $\mathbf{\omega_i}$ is fixed, all the outgoing directions fall on a hemisphere defined by the surface normal. After scaling, the BRDF values for $\mathbf{\omega_o}$ form a probability distribution over the hemisphere.  Hence, displacement interpolation can be applied to interpolate between materials, as in~\cite{bonneel-2011}.%While their method enforces a particular form for the BRDF,  convolutional barycenters can interpolate between arbitrary BRDFs defined on a grid.

%Unlike fitting BRDFs with the sum of Gaussian functions, our approach only requires simple 4-D grid BRDF representation. Moreover, \tao{Sorry I didn't quite understand your second point...} 

We use convolutional barycenters to combine more than two distributions at a time. For each incoming direction in the sampled BRDF, the values associated to the outgoing directions are organized in a 2D grid by spherical angle.  We use weighted Wasserstein barycenters to interpolate this data. The spherical heat kernel $\kernel$ is approximated by the fast approximate Gaussian convolution from~\cite{deriche-1993}.  Spherical geometry is accounted for by modulating the width of this separable filter.  We render images using the interpolated BRDFs using PBRT~\cite{pharr-2010}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:brdf} shows interpolation between four BRDFs using our technique, yielding continuously-moving highlights. The corner BRDFs are sampled from closed-form materials~\cite{blinn-1977,ashikhmin-2000}; the remaining BRDFs are interpolated.  

%  in the four corners except the bottom right one are regularly sampled from the Ashikhmin-Shirley BRDF model~\cite{ashikhmin-2000} with different anisotropic angles and exponents. The bottom right BRDF is discretized from the Blinn model of isotropic materials~\cite{blinn-1977}. 
%Our approach does not require prior knowledge of these parametric BRDF models. %\justin{not sure what this means}

Linearly interpolating BRDFs (left) yields spurious highlights, the convolutional barycenter (center) moves highlights continuously along the domain but increases diffusion, and the entropy-bounded barycenter (right) moves highlights in a sharper fashion.}\label{fig:brdf}
